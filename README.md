## Intro & Inspiration

Growing up, my love for games led me to learn coding with dreams of joining the game industry. Excitingly, this passion project came along – "The Hero's Tale," a choose-your-own-adventure game. Inspired by the adventure books I devoured growing up, it's a nod to childhood joy and a journey into the gaming world! 

With my background in gaming, strategy, and storytelling, I'm crafting this interactive fantasy on a website. 
You get to call the shots—there are three different endings, and it's all up to you. 
I want everyone of all ages to have fun with their own unique journey through this game.

# Creation Process  
  
## Developing a story


As I was researching, I understood what was required to build a story. Plus, I had played and read a number of books with a similar theme. It was clear I needed a straightforward yet well-organised game with obvious goals, obstacles, and outcomes to increase interaction and engagement.
The story would take several different turns, with each turn resulting in a different outcome.

I ended by choosing the Dragons and dungeons theme as they are the classic elements of fantasy and adventure stories, making them a natural fit for a “Choose Your Own Adventure” game. Players can explore fantastical environments and encounter mythical creatures, adding excitement and intrigue to the game. Plus, Dungeons are often filled with danger and mystery, providing opportunities for players to make decisions that affect their outcome. This can add tension and suspense to the game, keeping players engaged and invested in the story.

  

## World building

Wrote out the text for each part of the story, including descriptions of the scene, characters, and actions. I made sure to include the decisions that the player will make and the consequences that follow.

### Story structure for Javascript

The Hero's Tale is organised into distinct scenes, each representing a chapter or significant point in the narrative. The structure follows a simple format for ease of understanding and modification.

- Scenes
Each scene is defined as an object with the following properties:

- Title: Describes the title of the scene.
- Story: Contains the narrative content, including dynamic elements if necessary (e.g., player's name).
- Image: Refers to an image associated with the scene, enhancing the visual experience.
- Alt: Provides alternative text for accessibility purposes.
- Choices: Represents an array of choices available to the player. Each choice consists of a label and a destination, indicating the next scene.

#### Example

### **4. Wireframes & Navigation**  

A wireframe was executed  to plan and organise the content and functionality of a website, making it easier to design and build the site. Keeping in mind the user experience and ensuring that the website is easy to navigate and use. Plus determine the user interface and navigation for the game, including how the player will make decisions and how they will be taken to the next part of the story.

## Design  

### **Color Palette**  

Here is the colour palette, however the main colour purple was chosen as it is often associated with royalty, luxury, and mystery. It is also often associated with magic, mysticism, and the unknown, which can help to create a sense of mystery and awe around the dragon, making it feel more magical and otherworldly.

### **Typography**  
  
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) The following text font was chosen for the entire website. Using this font in  an interactive game enhances the overall style, making the game more approachable, and with personality.

### **Images**  
  
All Images and graphics were created via Canva. I have taken the time to design every scene cover to ensure that the website gives an interactive and narrative feel to it. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
