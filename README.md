# The Hero's Tale 

[View live project here on GitHub](https://solracnauj92.github.io/Hero-s-Tale/)

The Hero's Tale is an interactive fantasy tale website with a Choose Your Own Adventure game. The website gives the reader the option to decide how the story will develop and, ultimately, finish at different points in the narrative. The story can be concluded in any of three different ways. The reader has control over it. Basically it allows players to make decisions and choose their own path through the story, creating a personalised and unique experience for people of all ages.

## User Experience (UX)  
  
### **User Stories**  

### **Goal**  
  
Visitors to the website may come there for reasons other than finishing the quest, such as to take in the fascinating and engaging story that puts them in control of the outcome. To  provide players a chance to escape reality and experience various scenarios. The game intends to serve as a sort of escapism plus visitors can test and develop their decision-making abilities by making choices and then seeing the results of those actions.

 
### **First Time Visitor**

The first-time visitor's goal is to finish the quest. Regardless of how the story ends, they will still need to make the proper decisions to get there. The visitor is free to repeat the game as much as they like,  It provides a new experience each time they are played.


### **Returning Visitor**

A return visitor's goal is to take a different route to the finish. to uncover what might have followed if they had selected alternatives to their initial responses. Once again, They are free to repeat the game as much as they like.

  
### **Frequent Visitor**  

As Frequent visitors, they would frequently check to see whether the narrative had been updated, or one could simply wish to re-experience the game again on their own or with their friends or families.

## Creation Process  
  
### **1. Developing a story**  


As I was researching, I understood what was required to build a story. Plus, I had played and read a number of books with a similar theme. It was clear I needed a straightforward yet well-organised game with obvious goals, obstacles, and outcomes to increase interaction and engagement.
The story would take several different turns, with each turn resulting in a different outcome.

I ended by choosing the Dragons and dungeons theme as they are the classic elements of fantasy and adventure stories, making them a natural fit for a “Choose Your Own Adventure” game. Players can explore fantastical environments and encounter mythical creatures, adding excitement and intrigue to the game. Plus, Dungeons are often filled with danger and mystery, providing opportunities for players to make decisions that affect their outcome. This can add tension and suspense to the game, keeping players engaged and invested in the story.

  

### **2. World building**  

Wrote out the text for each part of the story, including descriptions of the scene, characters, and actions. I made sure to include the decisions that the player will make and the consequences that follow.

### **3. Targets**  

This game is designed to be easy to play and understand, making them accessible for people of all ages, including children and older adults. Plus it’s a game that can be highly engaging, as players must make decisions and solve problems in order to progress through the story. This can keep players of all ages invested and interested in the game.  

  
### **4. Wireframes & Navigation**  

A wireframe was executed  to plan and organise the content and functionality of a website, making it easier to design and build the site. Keeping in mind the user experience and ensuring that the website is easy to navigate and use. Plus determine the user interface and navigation for the game, including how the player will make decisions and how they will be taken to the next part of the story.

## Design  

### **Color Palette**  

Here is the colour palette, however the main colour purple was chosen as it is often associated with royalty, luxury, and mystery. It is also often associated with magic, mysticism, and the unknown, which can help to create a sense of mystery and awe around the dragon, making it feel more magical and otherworldly.  
  
![colour theme swatches](assets/images/palette.png)  
  
  
### **Typography**  
  
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) The following text font was chosen for the entire website. Using this font in  an interactive game enhances the overall style, making the game more approachable, and with personality.   
  
![google Fonts Poor Story](assets/images/font.jpg)

        
### **Images**  
  
All Images and graphics were created via Canva. I have taken the time to design every scene cover to ensure that the website gives an interactive and narrative feel to it. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
